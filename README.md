### Activity 

What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?

* The main activity that my project will support for users is to provide them the necessary steps and instruction to successfully complete building a shabby chic cork bulletin board.

What is the basic need involved for that activity? 

* My project/app will solve the users need of esteem. After successfully completing a daunting task such as this, the user will feel empowered for finishing the project and have a sense of accomplishment. 

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

* One of the current solutions for making a frame bulletin board is to go out and buy a ready made frame, which the object of this project is to make everything yourself along the way. A traditional way of going about this project would be to look up the different steps on the internet and try to find a blog that has the directions for the thing you want, e.g. how to build a frame and how to refinish wood in a shabby chic manner. 

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

*I think one of the main limiting factors is that the user may not understand the written instructions. Through the use of digital tools, we can make and upload pictures of how exactly the end product should look and videos that are a good visual guide of how to properly do each step. Having visuals like this are a good way to measure success and to, hopefully, prevent any injuries that could result from using woodworking tools.
